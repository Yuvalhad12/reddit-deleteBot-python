basically deletes all comments of the user if comment score is lower than (-2).

That's the first ever python script I have had ever developed, and looking at the code brought up so many memories.
I decided to improve it just a little with eveyrthing I have learned since:

1. added support for json indentation
2. added threading
3. decided to utilize the power of the cpu im running the script on, and now it runs every 60 seconds instead of 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
4. implemented try\except approach for finding the json file, instead if's and elses.


I have no intention to keep working on this script. I know it's not perfect and that OOP may have been more suitable here, but it's a basic script and it dets the job done fast enough.
